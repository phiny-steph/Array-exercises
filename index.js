2. The space western TV drama Firefly premiered in the United States on September 20, 2002. Although the show only featured fourteen episodes and was canceled during its first season, it continues to remain popular today with a growing fan base. In the show, the captain Mal, played by Nathan Fillion, leads a crew of renegades on the spaceship Serenity.

Create an array called crew to organize the Serenityâ€™s crew and set it equal to the variables below . You don't need to type out the actual strings, just use the provided variables.

let captain = "Mal";
let second = "Zoe";
let pilot = "Wash";
let companion = "Inara";
let mercenary = "Jayne";
let mechanic = "Kaylee";
Then, print the crew array to the console.

3. Starting with this array of prices, change the prices of the 1st, 3rd, and 7th elements in the array.
const prices = [1.23, 48.11, 90.11, 8.50, 9.99, 1.00, 1.10, 67.00];

4. James was creating an array with the colors of the rainbow, and he forgot some colors. The standard rainbow colors are usually listed in this order:

const rainbow = ["Red", "Orange", "Yellow", "Green", "Blue", "Purple"];

but James had this:

const rainbow = ["Red", "Orange", "Blackberry", "Blue"];

Using only the splice() method, insert the missing colors into the array, and remove the color "Blackberry" by following these steps:

Remove "Blackberry"
Add "Yellow" and "Green"
Add "Purple"

5. In the Harry Potter novels, children attending the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry belong to one of four houses: Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, or Slytherin. Each year, the houses assemble a Quidditch team of seven players to compete for the coveted Quidditch Cup.
Consider the following array.

const team = ["Oliver Wood", "Angelina Johnson", "Katie Bell", "Alicia Spinnet", "George Weasley", "Fred Weasley", "Harry Potter"];

Create a function called hasEnoughPlayers() that takes the team array as an argument and returns true or false depending on if the array has at least seven players.
