2. The space western TV drama Firefly premiered in the United States on September 20, 2002. Although the show only featured fourteen episodes and was canceled during its first season, it continues to remain popular today with a growing fan base. In the show, the captain Mal, played by Nathan Fillion, leads a crew of renegades on the spaceship Serenity.

Create an array called crew to organize the Serenity’s crew and set it equal to the variables below . You don't need to type out the actual strings, just use the provided variables.

let captain = "Mal";
let second = "Zoe";
let pilot = "Wash";
let companion = "Inara";
let mercenary = "Jayne";
let mechanic = "Kaylee";
Then, print the crew array to the console.

4. James was creating an array with the colors of the rainbow, and he forgot some colors. The standard rainbow colors are usually listed in this order:

const rainbow = ["Red", "Orange", "Yellow", "Green", "Blue", "Purple"];

Remove "Blackberry"
Add "Yellow" and "Green"
Add "Purple"

TIP: Check out the toFixed() method for numbers to help with rounding the values to a maximum of 2 decimal places. Note, that the method returns a string to maintain the "fixed" format of the number.
